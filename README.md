# CSharpFundys

## 📖 About
**CSharpFundys** is a curated collection of 20 practice problems designed to build strong fundamentals in the C# language. The primary goal of this repository is to bridge the gap between basic syntax knowledge and the ability to comfortably solve "Easy" level questions on LeetCode.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The problems in this repository were specifically compiled using Generative AI to ensure comprehensive coverage of essential programming concepts required for technical interviews and algorithmic thinking.

### Key Features
* **20 Unique Solutions:** A focused set of exercises to practice core coding skills.
* **Language:** Written entirely in C#.
* **Categorized Learning:** Problems are grouped into key conceptual areas:
    * Functions & Logic
    * Strings
    * Conditions & Loops
    * Arrays
* **Commented Thought Process:** Each solution includes detailed comments explaining the logic and approach, serving as a study guide for future reference.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The project is organized to separate the problem statements from the detailed logic:

* **`Program.cs`**: Acts as the entry point. The specific question prompts and descriptions for all 20 problems are listed here within the code comments.
* **Solutions File**: A separate class file contains the distinct functions for each solution. These functions are heavily commented to document the thought process and steps taken to arrive at the answer.
